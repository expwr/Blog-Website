This is a fully functional blog app in its very base version but as time moves on hopefully more features will be added to not only make the website better but further the skills I am already using 

This is built using nextjs but also has sanity v3 used as well which had just been released recently and is a very good option when creating websites due to the easy ui and an overall very cutomizable yet still coded features that make it stand out 

Ts is also the main language being used and as I progress further on I hop to get much better at it but this is the fisrt time I have used this 

MORE COMING SOON I DIDNT FEEL LIKE WRITING MORE HERE BUT THE COMMENTS IN THE ACTUAL CODE ARE GOING TO EXPLAIN MUCH MORE THORUOUGHLY BUT MORE WILL BE ADDED SOON....
